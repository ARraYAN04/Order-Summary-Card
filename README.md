## My process

I enojoyed doing the project though writing the CSS and matching it to the designs given took a lot of time. 
But figuring out GIT & GITHUB took sooo much more time than I thought it would. Hopefully it will be faster next time :) 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 

### What I learned

- Basic stuff about HTML and CSS
